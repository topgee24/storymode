    <h1>My Html Journey Through The Week</h1>
    <p>
 Class was postponed from 7am to 6pm in the evening. We were taught how to use free hosting platforms to host our websites,
examples of such websites are netlify, strinkingly, git etc. <br> We were tasked afterwards to host any project we had done either a personal project
or a project from freecodecamp. Well, throughout the week, I didn't really have time to practice my html on freecodeCamp or host the any project since I
didn't really understand what was going on but throght the week, I managed to complete 3 lessons on freecodeCamp to achieve 845 points on the freeCoeCamp
website. 
<h2>My FreeCodeCamp practice</h2>
<p>Last week Monday was the beginning of the week on which we were to complete our first lesson. I was way behind on the lesson. <br>
I decided to speed up since I was way behind. I was left with the <em>Ferris Wheel project, Cat Painting Project, Skyscraper project</em> etc.</p>
<h2>Completing the Ferris Wheel Project</h2>
<h3>Tuesday:</h3>
It was a bright morning on Tuesday and I was set to complete my ferris wheel project. The ferris wheel project was an interesting one. I learnt so many new things such as using the transform 
property to rotate my work. <br>
